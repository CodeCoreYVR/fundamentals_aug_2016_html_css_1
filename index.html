    <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
    <h2><em>by Robert Frost</em></h2>
    <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
       His house is in the village though;<br>
       He will not see me stopping here<br>
       To watch the woods fill up with snow.<br>

    <h1>Nothing Gold Can Stay</h1>
    <h2><em>by Robert Frost</em></h2>
    <p>Nature's first <strong>green</strong> is gold,<br>
       Her hardest hue to hold.<br>
       Her early leaf's a flower;<br>
       But only so an hour.<br>
